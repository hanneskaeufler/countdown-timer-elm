# jbrains learns some Elm

I don't know what I'm doing, but I'm trying.

This is a countdown timer that I'll eventually be able to use in my training courses. 
I've built this before in Javascript, so I'm trying to build it again in Elm.

## Please Help!

I don't know what I'm doing! I need your help. I especially want these things:

- Make illegal states unrepresentable.
- Learn idioms.
- Learn useful libraries.

Please submit pull requests or add comments. Optionally, [ping me on Twitter](//twitter.com/jbrains) to tell
me something. Send me articles to read. Thank you!

### A Specific Question

I don't like that an `ExpiredTimer` implies the `Frozen` Timer State. I can think of a few ways to deal with
that, but I'm interested in your impressions or in options I hadn't already considered. Please experiment
and/or advise!

- Warning events at 10 seconds, which play a jaunty sound.
- Expired event, which plays a different jaunty sound.
- Significantly less ugliness.
